        In this project, I set out to predict the average cost of food on Zomato. Analyzing the Zomat_Data_AP.csv dataset, I crafted a model that achieved a <span class="bold-and-bigger">70% accuracy score</span>. The outcome is a straightforward solution for estimating food prices on the platform, offering users valuable insights for informed decision-making.
